# Lando Configuration File for Drupal 8 & 9

An iteratively developed Lando configuration file.

We have begun to use [Lando](https://lando.dev/) nearly one and a half years ago.

Lando is really awesome.

As time goes by, we get used to Lando and see that it is so flexible.

This configuration file is the sum of our knowledge base of using Lando as a local development environment.

This will be updated and modified as needed.
